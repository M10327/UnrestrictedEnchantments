# UnrestrictedEnchantments
Changes how applying enchanted books to items in anvils works. It will now bypass any restrictions and allow you to enchant any item you want with any enchantment. Conflicting enchantments (such as sharpness and smite) will also work together. Conflicting enchantments can be added/removed in the config. All protections are still conflicting by default. All anvil recipes that are not putting an enchanted book onto items except for another enchanted book are handled by the vanilla anvil.

## Additional Enchantment functionality
All of these can be disabled in the config. Some have extra config options for damage and stuff
